## 🚩 Problem Statement
The Aadhaar ecosystem handles millions of transactions daily. While enrolment saturation is high, a critical vulnerability exists: **Fraudulent Enrolment Centers ("Ghost Centers").**

These rogue operators:
1.  **Farm "Biometric Updates"** (which are faster and less scrutinized) to hijack accounts or launder money.
2.  **Report Zero "New Enrolments"** (avoiding the rigorous new-user verification process).
3.  **Burn Government Resources** and compromise data integrity.

**The Challenge:** Detecting these anomalies in a dataset of billions of rows is like finding a needle in a haystack.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
I have developed the **UIDAI Operational Intelligence Center**—a real-time, AI-driven dashboard that ingests Enrolment, Biometric, and Demographic data to flag anomalies instantly.

### Key Features:
* **📍 Geospatial Heatmaps:** Instantly visualize "Hot Zones" of suspicious activity on an interactive map.
* **🚨 The "Suspicion Score":** A custom statistical metric that ranks every Pincode in India by fraud probability.
* **📉 Trend Analysis:** Compare "Healthy" vs. "Anomalous" center behavior over time.

## 🕵️ Key Investigation: The "Ghost Center" Discovery
During my analysis for the UIDAI Hackathon 2026, the algorithm flagged a massive anomaly in **South West Delhi**.

| Metric | Normal Center | **⚠️ Pincode 110086 (Identified Anomaly)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Biometric Updates** | ~150 - 500 / month | **7,625 / month** |
| **New Enrolments** | ~50 - 200 / month | **0 (Zero)** |
| **Suspicion Score** | < 10.0 | **7,625.0 (Critical Risk)** |

---

## ✊ Real-World Impact
This is not just a theoretical project. I have formally reported this specific anomaly to UIDAI officials for immediate investigation.

* **Official Case ID 1:** `SRN-S2054469731000`
* **Official Case ID 2:** `SRN-S2019698585000`

## 💻 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Jeevang1-epic/UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-BY-JEEVAN-KUMAR.git](https://github.com/Jeevang1-epic/UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-BY-JEEVAN-KUMAR.git)
cd UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-BY-JEEVAN-KUMAR

2. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Generate the Data
(I use a synthetic data generator to mimic the UIDAI dataset structure for privacy)
python data_setup.py

4. Run the Dashboard
streamlit run dashboard.py

## 📊 Algorithmic Logic
I define a Suspicion Score S for every location L to normalize fraud risk:
S_L = Total Biometric Updates/Total New Enrolments + 1

* **If S < 10:** Normal Operation (Balanced mix of services).
* **If S > 100:** High Risk (Investigation recommended).
* **If S > 1000:** **CRITICAL ANOMALY** (Immediate suspension recommended).


## 🔮 Future Roadmap
* **Phase 1 (Current):** Statistical Rule-Based Detection.
* **Phase 2:** Integration of **Unsupervised Machine Learning (Isolation Forests)** to detect subtler fraud patterns.
* **Phase 3:** Real-time API integration with UIDAI's live server for T+0 detection.
